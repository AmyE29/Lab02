                <h3>Hi! My name is Amy.</h3>
                In my past life I was in marketing. 
                I mostly created and maintained the corporate brochures.  I also
                was the tradeshow coordinator, which was a lot of fun, designing the booth
                and procuring the swag.  Towards the end of my career, I started to dabble in 
                web development, because my company was downsizing and we got rid of our webmaster, 
                so I took on the job.  This was back in the dark-ages of internet, so it wasn't very
                fancy, but I taught myself enough to get by, and it sparked my interest in coding.<br/><br/>

                Since then, I've been a stay-at-home mom for my 4 kids, ages 15, 13, and 10 year old twins.
                I kept myself busy being a room parent at the school, taking on the role of costume designer
                for the school musical, and being a total baseball/soccer/football mom.  If life circumstances hadn't forced
                me back into the work place, I would have been looking to restart my career anyway.  My job as "mom" was 
                winding down, and I am needing to recreate myself as something more. <br/><br/>

                I'm really looking forward to learning all I can in these classes.
